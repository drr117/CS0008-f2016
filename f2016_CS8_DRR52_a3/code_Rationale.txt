Unfortunately I only knew how to do certain parts of this program because I didn't pay adequate attention when dictionaries where brought up.
However, I can provide a rationale regarding what segments of code I did produce.
This is seen with the comments that I made in the "program".
As a whole, I wanted the user to type in a location for their overall file that contained the subfiles of data.
Following this, a function was created that opened this file and iterated through its contents with a for loop and readline function, 
which then opened the files within the main file and proceeded to read their contents as well. Acummulator Variables were set up for running totals, 
but the problem I ran into was that I could not easily find a way to implement a dictionary that allowed for participants to not be counted for twice. 
I collaborated with a fellow student Alex Shepard for a part of this program.
