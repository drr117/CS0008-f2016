I set up the program by first establishing a set of variables to define what the user is inputing.  I created a series of three input functions for the unit system the user wanted, for the distance the user traveled, and for the amount of fuel they used. 
Afterwards; I created a variable meant to calculate the usage of fuel. Following this I set up a conditional statement testing whether or not the user wanted standardized (USC) or Metric (METRIC) units; a new series of variables was made in order to be represented in the various printing functions that would need to be performed and to be used in the conversions to the other system of units. 
After the conversion; the fuel usage is calculated and then used to base the fuel rating on (Which is dependent on L/100km and not mpg).
The fuel rating was based on a series of elif statements; because it changes based on its numerical value.  The process described above was used for both systems of units; each having their own separate print functions in order to distinguish them from each other. It should be noted that I recieved assistance from my fellow student Alex Shepard with regard on how to format the numbers in Python.
